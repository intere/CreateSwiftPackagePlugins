Reconstructed an example from [WWDC 2022 - Create Swift Package plugins](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110401)

Simple project that includes:
- Command line tool (main.swift)
- Plugin (interface between SPM / Xcode and the CLI tool)
- SwiftUI View (where we test the plugin / CLI)
